                <h1>Ababa Steak owner migrates to Jakarta</h1>
                <p>
                    Quoting from the Kontan article, the story of Abu Bakar establishing Ababa Steak is unique. Not having a higher education and a lot of capital, he was able to successfully establish Ababa Steak. Now, it has developed into a mid-level restaurant chain. Abu Bakr was also not a good cook. He even had to drop out of school in the fifth grade of elementary school because his father was sick and died. During his youth he was a hard worker. Abu, who at that time was pressed for economic needs, had to leave for Jakarta. He became the breadwinner of the family and had to support his mother and five siblings. In the capital, at first he worked as a stone mason and laborer. At the age of 17, Abu received an offer to work as a dishwasher at a restaurant in Kemang, South Jakarta.

                <h1>Working in hotels and restaurants</h1>
                <p>
                    This is where his career in business began. After several months of working as a dishwasher, he was trusted to work in the cooking section, namely frying. But after a few months, he was forced to be unemployed because the restaurant business was receding. Not giving up, he continued to look for work. Abu Bakar had worked in several restaurants and hotels. Hotel Sahid, Hotel Kemang, and restaurant Ponderosa (Amigos) are some of the culinary places where he has worked there. For a dozen years he learned a lot about various local and Western cuisine menus. Departing from not many skills in the culinary field, Abu continued to hone his cooking skills in 1987. At that time he worked as a cook in an offshore oil drilling company around Natuna Island. Here, he met a chef from Texas, United States. From this chef, he learned how to make burgers and steaks.

                    After getting a very good response from consumers, Abu continues to innovate. It serves a more modern dish. The place to eat has also moved to a wider location, don't forget to add employees. In 2010 Abu handed over the management of Ababa Steak to Ali Ariansyah, his only child. He realized that his business needed a more modern system and management. Ali, who graduated from a hotel school in Switzerland, brought the Ababa Steak business to a fast pace. Ababa set up another outlet in Jakarta to reach out to customers. Ababa Steak Restaurant also started working on a higher market segment. The proof is that some of Ababa's outlets are located in upper middle class residential areas such as Summarecon Serpong, Kelapa Gading, and Tebet.
